# Mapping Heart Health Risks

## Introduction
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Understanding the distribution and key indicators of heart disease can help identify at-risk populations and focus on preventive measures. This Tableau dashboard visualizes heart disease risks by analyzing age distribution, gender prevalence, and key health metrics to provide actionable insights.

## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to:
- Explore the age distribution of individuals at risk of heart disease, identifying peak age groups.
- Analyze gender-based prevalence to highlight disparities in heart disease risk.
- Compare vital health indicators, including cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting blood pressure, and maximum heart rate, between individuals with and without heart disease.

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights the following key insights:   
- Heart disease risk peaks between the ages of 55-65, with a gradual decline thereafter.
- Men are at a higher risk of heart disease across all age groups, with significant disparities observed in ages 55-65.
- Elevated resting blood pressure and fasting blood sugar are strong risk factors for heart disease, as individuals with heart disease show significantly higher values compared to normal 
 individuals.

These insights emphasize the importance of monitoring key health metrics, particularly for men and individuals over 50, to mitigate heart disease risk effectively
